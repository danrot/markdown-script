# Markdown Script

This is a collection of files useful to create scripts using pandoc to translate a markdown file to PDF. The `make`
command is used to easily create a self-contained PDF document.

This package is used as a submodule in the [`script-template`](https://github.com/danrot/script-template).  Whenever
something in this repository is updated, the changes can be included in all projects based on top of the script
template by switching the tag of the submodule.

## Prerequisites

- [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) has to be installed and be available in the `PATH`
- The [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) command has to be available in the `PATH`
be generated
